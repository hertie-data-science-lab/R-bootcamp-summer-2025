# NYC Flights in 2013

For these exercises, we will use the dataframe `flights` from the `nycflights13` package, which has one row per flight that departed from New York City in 2013 (336776 rows).

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

if (!("nycflights13" %in% installed.packages())) {
  install.packages("nycflights13")
}
library(nycflights13)
flights <- flights

flights
```

Exercises 1 through 4 come from (or were adapted from) [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/data-transform.html#exercises). Hint: these exercises can be solved with `filter()`, `distinct()`, and `count()`.

1. Was there a flight on every day in 2013?

2. Find all flights that arrived more than two hours late but didnâ€™t leave late.

3. Find all destinations that had at least one flight with a flight time of 12 hours or more.

4. Find all flights in the summer (June, July, August) that arrived on time. (Hint: you can combine filters or use `%in%` to see if a value is in a vector like `value %in% c(values)`).

5. Among flights
