# Using R as a Calculator

## The Console in RStudio

![The red box is the console where you can freely run R code. I included a few examples of using R + RStudio as a calculator. `==` means equal to.](images/r-as-calculator-01.png)

## R Operators

R includes many operators, including:

::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="40%"}
### Arithmetic
- `+` : Addition
- `-` : Subtraction
- `*` : Multiplication
- `/` : Division
- `^` : Exponentiation
:::

::: {.column width="40%"}
### Relational
- `==` : Equal to
- `!=` : Not equal to
- `<` : Less than
- `>` : Greater than
- `<=` : Less than or equal to
- `>=` : Greater than or equal to
:::

::: {.column width="20%"}
### Logical
- `&`: AND
- `|`: OR
- `!`: NOT
:::

## Exercises

1. Calculate the number of hours in a year.
2. Calculate the population density of Berlin (Let's say 3897145 persons in 891.3 $km^2$)

## Solution

```{r}
#| echo: true
365 * 24
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
3897145 / 891.3
```

# Objects

## What is an object in R?

An object in R is a named container that stores data, results, or functions. Objects are assigned to names using the assignment operator `<-`. For example:

```{r}
#| echo: true
name <- "Jackson M Luckey"
year <- 2025
two_plus_two <- 2 + 2
two_times_two <- 2 * 2
```

We can then use these objects:

```{r}
#| echo: true
two_plus_two == two_times_two
```

## The Environment Pane in RStudio

![The red box is the environment pane, which shows all the objects in your current R session](images/r-objects-01.png).

## Exercises

Using objects, calculate the population density of Berlin (3897145 persons in 891.3 $km^2$) along the lines of

```{r}
#| echo: true
days_in_year <- 365
hours_in_day <- 24
hours_in_year <- days_in_year * hours_in_day

hours_in_year
```

## Solution

```{r}
#| echo: true
berlin_pop <- 3897145
berlin_area <- 891.3
berlin_pop_density <- berlin_pop / berlin_area

berlin_pop_density
```
