# Hertie School's 2025 Summer R and Math Bootcamp

Taught by [Jackson Luckey](http://www.jacksonmluckey.com) at the [Hertie School in Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/) in summer 2025.

Before the first day, please install [R](01-overview/bootcamp-overview.html#installing-r) and [RStudio](01-overview/bootcamp-overview.html#installing-rstudio).

## Slides

1. [Overview](01-overview/bootcamp-overview.html): Overview of what we will cover during the bootcamp.
2. [Git](02-git/git-intro.html): Introduces Git to get everyone to the point that they can use this repo throughout the bootcamp.
3. [Intro to R](03-R-intro/intro-to-R.html): Introduces the basics of base R (objects, vectors, functions, and dataframes).
4. [Intro to Data Visualization](04-intro-to-data-viz/intro-to-data-viz.html): Introduces the basics of data visualization with R using ggplot2.
5. [Working with Dataframes with `dplyr`](05-dplyr/working-with-dataframes-with-dplyr.html): Covers the main `dplyr` verbs (functions) such as `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `summarize()`, and `group_by()`.
6. [Vectors and Matrices](06-vectors-matrices/vectors-and-matrices.html)
7. [Working with Dataframes in Base R](07-dataframes-base-R/working-with-dataframes-in-base-R.html):
8. [Pushing and Pulling with Git](08-git-push-pull/pushing-and-pulling-git.html)

## Exercises

The prerequisites (unless stated otherwise) are the [Intro to Data Visualization](04-intro-to-data-viz/intro-to-data-viz.html) and [Working with Dataframes with `dplyr`](05-dplyr/working-with-dataframes-with-dplyr.html) slides.

- [`dplyr` and `ggplot` with NYC Flights](Exercises/nyc-flights/nyc-flights.qmd): Practice using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` with a dataset of all flights departing NYC in 2013.
- [Leader Assassination as a Natural Experiment](Exercises/leader-assassination/leader-assassination.qmd): Practice using `dplyr` and `ggplot2` to investigate the effects of leader assassinations on democracy and war.

## Sources

This course borrows liberally from Simon Munzert's [Introduction to Data Science (IDS) course](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/) as the bootcamp primarily serves as preparation for the course.

I also took inspiration, examples, and exercises from:

- [R Intro in the R Manual](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html)
- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
