# Hertie School's 2025 Summer R and Math Bootcamp

Taught by [Jackson Luckey](http://www.jacksonmluckey.com) at the [Hertie School in Berlin](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/).

Before the first day, please go through TODO add links to the two slides in bootcamp-overview

## Course Sections

1. [Overview](01-overview/bootcamp-overview.html): Overview of what we will cover during the bootcamp.
2. [Git](02-git/git-intro.html): Introduces Git to get everyone to the point that they can use this repo throughout the bootcamp.
TODO consider splitting Intro to R into two sections to do some fun and easy data viz before we fiddle with `[[]]` vs `[]` vs `$`
3. [Intro to R](03-R-intro/intro-to-R.html): Introduces the basics of base R (objects, vectors, functions, and dataframes).

This course borrows liberally from Simon Munzert's [Introduction to Data Science (IDS) course](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/) as it primarily serves as preparation for the course.

I also took inspiration, examples, and small chunks of materials from:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
- [Quantiative Social Science: An Introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691175461/quantitative-social-science)
