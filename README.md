This course borrows liberally from Simon Munzert's [Introduction to Data Science (IDS) course](https://github.com/intro-to-data-science-24/) as it primarily serves as preparation for the course.

I also took inspiration and examples from:

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/)
- [Quantiative Social Science: An Introduction](https://press.princeton.edu/books/paperback/9780691175461/quantitative-social-science)
