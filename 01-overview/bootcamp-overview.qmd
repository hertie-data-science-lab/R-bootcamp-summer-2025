## Welcome

I'm [Jackson Luckey](https://www.jacksonmluckey.com). I graduated from Hertie's master's in data science for public policy (MDS) program this summer and am starting a PhD in quantitative social science with [Asya Magazinnik](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/magazinnik-1) and [Drew Dimmery](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/who-we-are/profile/person/dimmery) at Hertie, so you'll see me around during your studies.
