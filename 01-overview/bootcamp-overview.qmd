## Welcome

I'm [Jackson Luckey](https://www.jacksonmluckey.com). I graduated from Hertie's master's in data science for public policy (MDS) program this summer and am starting a PhD in quantitative social science with [Asya Magazinnik](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/research/faculty-and-researchers/profile/person/magazinnik-1) and [Drew Dimmery](https://www.hertie-school.org/en/who-we-are/profile/person/dimmery) at Hertie, so you'll see me around during your studies.

## Bootcamp Overview

Over the next three days, we'll cover the basics of R + RStudio, Git, and make some fun data visualizations.

## R and RStudio

[R](https://www.r-project.org) is a programming language designed for statistical computing (data analysis, statistics, machine learning, and data visualization).

[RStudio](https://posit.co/products/open-source/rstudio) is an integrated development environment (IDE) designed for using R.

## Installing R

On MacOS:

- [Newer Macs (ARM M-series from 2020 onwards)](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/macosx/big-sur-arm64/base/R-4.5.1-arm64.pkg)
- [Older Intel Macs](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/macosx/big-sur-x86_64/base/R-4.5.1-x86_64.pkg)

On Windows:

- [R](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/windows/base/R-4.5.1-win.exe)
- [Rtools -- needed on Windows](https://cran.uni-muenster.de/bin/windows/Rtools/rtools45/files/rtools45-6608-6492.exe)

If you use a package manager (e.g. Homebrew, Macports, Winget, Apt, or Pacman), download R there.

## Installing RStudio

[Windows](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/windows/RStudio-2025.05.1-513.exe)

[MacOS](https://download1.rstudio.org/electron/macos/RStudio-2025.05.1-513.dmg)

Or use a package manager.
